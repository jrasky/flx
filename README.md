# flx
Fast, character-based search library in Rust

Inspired by [flx for emacs](https://github.com/lewang/flx), uses the same basic algorithm.

This is basically the search function in BIS in a separate library. It works somewhat decently for bash history.

To use:
```toml
flx = {git = "https://github.com/jrasky/flx.git"}
```

Build documentation with ```cargo doc```
